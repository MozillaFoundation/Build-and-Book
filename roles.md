## Project Roles: who does what?

**Every project has a set of roles**. We list these roles clearly in the project's **Planning Ticket**. (Note: Planning Tickets are special. More on that here.)

**Clearly defined roles make projects run smooth**. In particular: 
- 1) **Ensuring every project has a capable Driver**. The driver is like the Project Manager. The're the task-master and glue. They're responsible for ensuring that meetings happen, that individual tasks are clear and well documented, and that the work gets done on time. 
- 2) **Understanding the difference between the "Driver" and the "Decision-Maker".** This often confuses peope. The driver steers the car; the Decision-Maker decides where to go. They Decision-Maker is ultimately in charge. They don't need to be involved in the minutiae of every single task (that's the Driber's job.) But they set the overall goal, answer key questions, and decide whether the work meets the goal.
- 3) **Taking quality seriously**. Every project has a Quality Verifier. We can't just finish work and chuck it out the door; we need to take the time to ensure it's done right and that our users will love it. That buck stops with the Quality Verifier. 

##Gimme an example
**Decision-Maker**: "We're going to make carrot soup. It needs to be served at lunch on Feb 21. The metrics for success are: at least 20 happy soup customers." 
**Driver**: "Ok. I'll schedule a Project Kick-Off meeting. And make sure the individual tasks required (buy carrots, chop carrots, sautee and blend carrots, serve soup) are clearly ticked and assigned."
**Design Lead**: "I'll be responsible for ensuring all design work required for the soup gets done."
**Development Lead**: "And I'll do the same for any engineering work required."
**Quality Verifier**: "Great! I'll be responsible for doing a final check to ensure the soup is hot, tasty, and something we're proud to serve."
**Driver**: "Hey -- could it be potato soup instead? And is it ok if we ship it Feb 27?"
**Decision-Maker**: "Nope, not this time. It needs to be carrot soup. On Feb 21."
**Driver**: "Okey dokey."
