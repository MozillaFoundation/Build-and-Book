## DRAFT Mozilla Clubs at Community Meet-Ups

 

### You already have a regular time scheduled to meet (could be monthly, bi-monthly), as well as a space and audience to draw from. 
- Mix up your usual meet-up by adding hands-on activities that get your participants making and learning together.
- Help further your community meetup objectives by providing a method “teach like mozilla” that enables you to create your own activities based on participatory methods and peer learning/mentorship.

### What is the value of Mozilla Clubs to this particular audience? 
Peer learning is an effective way to strengthen your community and ensure participants get a lot out of their involvement.
Share activities and content that attendees can then bring back to their own contexts (whether in their school, workplace, community, etc.). Participatory processes and informal learning tools that can be used to create and adapt activities that are focused on the same things that your community is interested in. Be a part of a global initiative and exchange stories and feedback across the world. 

### How can you get started:
- Try our easy-to-use activities get you started without special training or preparation.
- Introduce the Mozilla Clubs activities into your regular meet-up and adapt them to your groups’ interests. [link to first 30 days as Club Captain]
- Be a part of our discussions on discourse and give feedback on our material

### Audience/target participants:
Adult or young professionals meeting on a regular basis for:
general networking around shared goals/interests
training/skills development 
Local Mozilla community
[Are we targeting established groups such as scouts and other large youth oriented groups?]

### Learning motivations::
 Looking to meet new people, learn new skills, make connections
 Learn through informal methods.
Learn by sharing, become a mentor.
Be a part of a larger community and cause positive social impact in your area.
Help spread knowledge about how to build the web we want.
Empower people to put their voice on the web

### Tools
Forum for people to exchange feedback and stories
Set of activities and curriculum
Software tools such as webmaker apps and its siblings
Written material such as activities, guides and kits
Online portal (discourse) to exchange feedback, stories and ideas.
[QUESTION: what is the difference between tools and support. In my mind tools are the inanimate stuff and support are the services we give them but I am not sure]

### Support
Materials: We have training materials that are available online (and downloadable?) that offer step-by-step instructions and guidance on everything from XX to XX.
Individual support: When you start a Mozilla Club, you’ll be assigned a Regional Coordinator to support you through the process of getting set up. 
Peer support: Connect with others who are running similar programs at their community meet-ups in our online forum (Discourse). This is a great place to post questions, share challenges and successes, and generally connect with a global community of people like you who want to teach the web.

We spent a bulk of Q1 researching, developing and testing a new site that will serve as a hub for all Mozilla Learning Networks initiatives. The site, which will live at teach.mozilla.org, is on track for a soft launch in mid-April. This is the first time we’ll have a dedicated site that integrates our full offering. In Q2, we'll scope and start to build a directory for our community to more easily connect with each other based on their expertise and interests, and will add more dynamic content to the site, i.e. blogs, curriculum, community features.

{LINK} Based on some of the [reflections from Mozilla's recent involvement at Mobile World Congress](https://blog.webmaker.org/reflections-on-mobile-world-congress-the-power-of-an-open-mobile-web), we see a big opportunity to teach mobile web literacy while inviting creativitity connected to locally relevant content.
