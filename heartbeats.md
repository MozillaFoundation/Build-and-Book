Working in two-week “Heartbeats"
============

###Mercifully brief super-summary:
- **We work in two-week "heartbeats" or "sprints"**. Translating our quarterly goals into bite-sized pieces we can hack on and learn from quickly. 
- **Everything is transparent.** To see what we're working on this Heartbeat, go here: http://build.webmaker.org/now To see what's on deck for the next one, go here: http://build.webmaker.org/next
- **Anyone can propose a project.** So long as it fits with our mission and goals. (e.g., we're probably not going to build your octocopter.) Use the project intake form here: http://build.webmaker.org/add
- **We work together across teams.** Heartbeats focus on mini-projects where people work together _directly_, regardless of the org chart. Designers, developers, project managers, community members, fundraisers, cats, dogs -- we all sprint together. 
- **We set clear priorities for each heartbeat.** Top priorities are labelled "P1." Others are "P2." P1 means *must* do. P2 means "do if we have time." P2s that don't get done in one heartbeat move to the front for the next one. 
- **We have a Heartbeat planning meeting at the start.** Each key project then has a **kick-off meeting** to make sure everyone's clear on roles and on the same page. 
- **We demo what we got done at the end** All P1s demo, even if they're not done. We share what we learned. Demos are fun. You should come. 


##Why work in Heartbeats?
* *Openness*. More visibility for all stakeholders.         
* *Continuous improvement*. Move faster, work smoother, work better. 
* *Cross-team collaboration*. With fewer meetings, red tape and org chart boxes.

A typical heartbeat

**Here’s what a typical two-week process might look like** (TL;DR version):

* *Monday*: 
1) **Clean up from the last Heartbeat**. Tie off loose ends. Push to production, write blog posts or documentation, water the plants, etc. 
2) **Have a Heartbeat Planning Meeeting**. Decide and prioritize what we’re doing next. Publicly share out that plan with the world. 
3) **Make sure there's a clear Planning Ticket for each project**. That clearly lists the goal, key roles, deadlines and metrics for success. 

* *Tuesday*: **Project Kick-Off Meetings**. Get together in small project teams around those priorities. Brainstorm, plan and whiteboard together. Make sure everyone is on the same page and has what they need to get started.

* *2nd Monday*: half-way point. How we doing?

* *2nd Friday*: **Demo what we got done**. Review what we learned. 

*For “P1″ projects*: layer on daily 15-minute stand-up meetings. To make sure any questions and problems get addressed fast.

*That’s it!* Layer on whatever other meeting, communicating and dance parties required. Rinse and repeat.

# New tools and dashboards

New project intake process. Anyone is able to propose a piece of work at [build.webmaker.org/add](https://build.webmaker.org/add). It guides you through a project intake process and template that will help us put distributed leadership into action.

##More meat
* **Kick-off** meetings. These are an art -- and an extremely important part of making the overall process work. 
* **Stand-up meetings** -- these are short (15 minutes max), start precisely on time, and are there to ensure you get help fast.  
* **Demos** -- tips and tricks for how we do demos at the end of each Heartbeat.
* **Sign-off checklist**-- how do we know when someone's done and ready to ship? How do we do Quality Assurance (QA) and make sure nothing blows up?
