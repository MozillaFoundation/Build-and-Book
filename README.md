# Building the Mozilla Foundation together

[Our goal: fuel the movement](https://wiki.mozilla.org/MoFo_2020) to grow and protect the promise of the open internet. Together we will shape the agenda, connect leaders and rally citizens.

**How we work: open, agile, mission-driven.** With a big emphasis on continous learning, collaborating across teams, and driving new forms of participation at Mozilla.
