# How we work
**Open. Agile. Fun.** Working hands-on with our global community. Thatâ€™s how we work at [Mozilla Webmaker.](http://webmaker.org/) This handbook documents the **systems**, **tools** and **controlled chaos** we use to do that. [Let us know](https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/book.webmaker.org/issues/new) if you have questions, suggestions or see something here that's missing or wrong -- or just say hello any time.

### Our mission
**[Our non-profit mission](http://webmaker.org/about) is to build a more web literate world**, empowering people to teach and learn the skills they need to thrive, create and lead in a digital age. We're deeply committed to working the open source way. Our goal is clear documentation, on-ramps, and clear ways to see and track our work. With a shared vision what we're working on together each two-week [sprint](http://build.webmaker.org/now), [quarter](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Foundation/2015/Q1) and [year](https://blog.webmaker.org/2015_plan).
