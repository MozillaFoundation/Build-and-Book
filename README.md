The Book of Webmaker
=====

This book is where we're documenting how MoFos work on making stuff together.

It is intended for both staff and volunteers who want to help us achieve the goals set in the [2015 plan](learning2015_plan.html).

The [first chapter](heartbeats.html) is ready for review -- it covers heartbeats and our usage of GitHub issues in particular.  Please [file issues](https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/book.webmaker.org/issues/) if you see things that are wrong, missing, or just confusing.
