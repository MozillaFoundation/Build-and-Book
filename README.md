The Book of Webmaker
=====

This book is where we're documenting how MoFos work on making stuff together.

It is intended for both staff and volunteers who want to help us achieve the goals set in the [2015 plan](/learning2015/plan).

This can now be edited by properly authorized folks using [prose.io](http://prose.io/#MozillaFoundation/book.webmaker.org) or just directly through [github](https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/book.webmaker.org/) and saves/pushes will result in an update to the [site](http://mofobook.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/).

This is now on a mofo bucket.
