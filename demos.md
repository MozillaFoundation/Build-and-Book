MC [Insert your name here]
As Ricardo demonstrated today … it’s way more fun when we have different folks leading the call! If you’d like to MC, please volunteer in the demos pad.

5 minutes
You now have 5 minutes to give your demo. Make it count! A couple pointers:
     - Provide context: Try to explain the what and why of your demo up front. Communicate why it's important!
     - User perspective: It helps us all understand your demo if you walk through it from the user’s perspective. A user might be someone who found Webmaker through Firefox, a contributor, or even a fellow designer or engineer.
     - Have an ask: What do you need to keep going? Design feedback, QA support, deployment assistance, high fives, moar coffee? Think about what kind of action you want from the group and direct participants on where to follow-up.
     - Details in the pad: Try to focus on the most important and impactful parts of your demo. The pad is a great place to share details and links if participants are interested to learn more.
     - Prepare for the worst: If you are worried about the reliability of your demo, produce a video beforehand and share it in the pad.

Questions & Comments
While we always need to find ways to provide helpful feedback and ask questions, demos have proven to be a pretty hard place for us to provide rich discussion. With that in mind, let’s use the pad and follow-ups if needed to address discussion. This will help us keep demos moving and (hopefully) provide a better channel for Q&A.
