#How we do demos#

**Rotating MCs**. It’s more fun when we have different folks leading the call. If you’d like to MC, please volunteer in the [demos pad](https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/foundation-demos).

**5 minutes**
You have about 5 minutes to give your demo. Make it count! A few pointers:
- **Provide context**: Try to explain the what and why of your demo up front. Communicate why it's important!
- **User perspective**: It helps us all understand your demo if you walk through it from the user’s perspective. A user might be someone who is part of a target audience, a contributor or a fellow designer or engineer.
- **Have an ask**: What do you need to keep going? Design feedback, QA support, deployment assistance, high fives, moar coffee? Think about what kind of action you want from the group and direct participants on where to follow-up.
- **Details in the pad**: Try to focus on the most important and impactful parts of your demo. The pad is a great place to share details and links if participants are interested to learn more.
- **Consider making a video**: If you are worried about the reliability of your demo, produce a video beforehand and share it in the pad.
