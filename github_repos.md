## <a name="whichrepo"></a>Which GitHub repo should I use?

**Where should I file my ticket?** There are many different repos in the [MozillaFoundation organization](https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/) and [Mozilla org](https://github.com/mozilla/?query=mofo).

## <a name="whatsplan"></a>What's the "plan" repo?
The Plan repo is special. It's where we track our high-level projects for each Heartbeat. We try to save it just for big stuff, and keep it free of clutter. It's for projects ("build a car"), not itty bitty tasks ("fill the gas tank" or "install the steering wheel." Those go in one of the other repos listed above. 

## <a name="wherenew"></a>Where should I create a repo?

If it involves software, it hsould generally go under the `mozilla` org. But it may make sense to start exploring in your personal repo until you're ready for collaborators.  We can transfer a repo from an individual to an org when that's needed. 

Other work can be housed under orgs like `mozilla`, `MozillaFoundation` or `MozillaHive`.
