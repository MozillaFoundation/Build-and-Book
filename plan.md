##Planning Tickets##

Planning Tickets are special tickets that are different from others. 

They're for high-level tracking and co-ordinating, instead of granular little tasks and bugs. e.g., "**Get the kid ready for school**" vs. "Brush kids's teeth," "Get kid dressed," "Serve kid breakfast," etc. 

For example: "Get kid ready for school" is a Planning Ticket or meta-ticket. vs. "Brush kid's teeth," "Get dressed," "Serve breakfast,"  There's a special intake form for them, to make sure they're fully fleshed out and carefully thought through.) 

We invest a lot of extra time at the start of each Heartbeat to get the Planning Tickets just right. To make sure we're all clear and teed up for success.")
