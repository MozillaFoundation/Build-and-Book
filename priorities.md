Every **Planning Ticket** has a priority label attached to it:  "P1" or "P2." These labels get discussed and set at the beginning of each Heartbeat, in the Heartbeat Planning Meeting. 

**"P1" means: must do**. Often this means that there's a hard external deadline associated with it. Like a launch date or birthday party. 
**"P2" means: _try_ to do**. If we have time left over from our P1s, we'll try to get these done as well. (And we often do.)

###How do we decide what's a P1? 
- **Our quarterly goals**. We set goals and KPIs for the year, and for each quarter. This guides on how to set our overall priorities, instead of just making stuff up every two weeks. 
- **External deadlines**. Is the deadline soft or hard? Does it need to be ready for an external date we can't change, or do we have some flexibility on timing? 
- **Does it require design or engineering work?** These resources are finite, so we can only commit to a finite number of P1s each sprint. 
- **What else is on our plate?** This is the fine art of collaboration, negotiation and juggling. What are our other demands and resource constraints each Heartbeat?
- **Did it not get completed in the last Heartbeat?** Uncompleted P2s in the last Heartbeat get special consideration to become P1s in the next Heartbeat. 

###Tips for getting your project prioritized
- **Use the handy project form.** 
- **Clearly state the metrics for success.** Otherwise, it's impossible to tell whether the effort is worth it. 
- **Understand and reference our quarterly goals.** Our priorities aren't a secret -- we post them publicly. Help us help you help us. :)
