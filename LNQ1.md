## Mozilla Learning Networks Program Review March 2015

### The overall goal of this program is to establish Mozilla as the best place to teach and learn the mechanics, culture and citizenship of the web. We promote [Mozilla's mission](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/mission/) by educating people about how the web is an open platform for creativity and collaboration. 

Our community is comprised of educators and activists. Activists are driven by our mission and join us to develop skills to teach the web and share their knowledge with others. Educators join us because they want to embed the web and digital literacy into their practice, and help their learners understand the possibilities offered by the open web.   

In 2015, we aim to achieve this by:
- **Mobilizing** more educators
- **Creating** new tools, programs and practices
- **Catalyzing** innovations across networks
- **Growing** demand for Mozilla events, communities and networks

_**In 2015, our key performance indicator (KPI)is 500 cities with ongoing Learning Network activity.**_

Our work emcompasses several key programs, with varying levels of engagement.

##Maker Party

Mozilla Web Clubs is a new initiative for us this year. It evolved from the success of Maker Party, which is a campaign we’ve been running for the last few years towards activation.
With Mozilla Web Clubs, we want to take these sparks of activation from Maker Party and sustain them year round. 
Clubs are local groups teaching the web on a regular basis. 


Here’s an early sentiment from our testing. Our approach with clubs is to offer rigorous skills development. And we also want to model social, participatory learning. Research shows this is one of the most effective ways to teach and learn. 


We started the year with 7 Hive cities, we had momentum following the Hive Global Meet-Up at MozFest. It allowed for in-person connections + collaborations across cities. 

We’re getting better at the right motivators and on-the-ground support.


We needed to first identify the contributors from last year that we can directly communicate with. We reviewed and cross-checked contributors like Hive members, badge-earners, Maker Party organizers that also opted-in to hearing our messages. 
Now, we can direct more overt calls-to-action and dynamic offerings to highlight how these 2,500 local leaders may gain value from ongoing engagement.

Current mailing list subscriber count is closer to 40K - that doesn’t mean we counted them as contributors last year (Maker Party hosts, skill-sharers, etc. They just signed up on a list)

Slide 10 - Q1 Key initiatives (Clubs/Hive/Teach)[MICHELLE]

Clubs 
We curated the first module to teach web literacy. It’s a series of 6 community-grown activities covering the foundations of reading, writing and participating on the web
We field-tested with educators and learners. 40 volunteers from 24 cities including Helsinki (Finland), Pune (India), Baltimore (US), Wellington (NZ), and Cape Town (S. Africa). 
The curriculum is ready to teach using mobile phones and/or with low connectivity.
To ensure that clubs are well serviced and their leaders continue to grow, we’re also adopting a more intentional volunteer organizing model that includes three specific roles: Club Leader, Regional Coordinator, and Organizer.
This was heavily informed by other organizations like Obama for America, Free the Children, and Coder Dojo. 

Hive 
We clarified a pathway for cities to become an official Hive Community. 
These communities have a dedicated team. 
Their efforts are part of Hive Global but also highly localized, to meet their local reality.
Furthermore, these teams are seeking funding to sustain their network.

Also Hive as testbed for curriculum for clubs


Teach.mozilla.org
We’re on track for a soft launch of the new website in the next two weeks. 
This really is the first time we’ll have a dedicated site that integrates our full offering.
The process by which we’ve developed the website has worked well. The internal MoFo investment in how to assign design and dev resources is paying off. 

Slide 11 - Q1 Key Initiatives (Badges/Maker Party/MozFest) [MICHELLE]

Badges
Our focus in Q1 was deciding on a strategy to continue to use our badges as a tool for our work. 
We started with how to enhance the user experience for badge issuers and badge earners. For example improving the badge review queue and how to access badge “evidence” after the badge is issued
We bumped the badges improvement throughout the quarter to prioritize building the teach.mozilla.org site.

Maker Party
Just last week the proposal for Maker Party 2015 was approved. This year, we’ll focus efforts on a two week campaign in July (historically the busiest two weeks of the campaign)
The goal is to tee up year-long engagement and seed more clubs.
We’ll use activities from the Clubs curriculum as a hook to drive participation.

MozFest
We’ve set the dates for Nov. 6 - 8 in London. 
A focus this year is on leadership development. MozFest will offering training to our Regional Club coordinators and general skill development. 
We’ll also continue the successful Hive Global meet-up, which catalyzed new cities and collaborations.

## The View from Above

Here is some insight regarding aligned movements and organizations that are also in the digital learning space. Note that we also see Mozilla as a key driver in this space, and think we've done a good job of partnering with others, by finding ways to align external campaigns with our values, tools and community. 

****"Learning to code" and computer science are more mainstream****
Huge campaigns like Code.org’s Hour of Code, and Google’s “CS First” bring introductory and sustained programs to youth. Coding is generally seen as a more valued skill than it has been in the past -- but we’re not always sure to what end.

****Hands-on pedagogy is also gaining popularity****
Making and DIY culture has become more prominent in the education space, with Maker Media as a leading force. In 2014, there was the first-ever White House Maker Faire and a declaration for a new National Day of Making. Tools such as Scratch, Minecraft and littleBits are being more widely used in third party digital learning programs, while they're also expanding efforts to build their own global communities with local nodes. 

****The mobile Web presents new possibilities****
Over the next few years, billions of first-time web users will come online via mobile devices. Based on some of the [reflections from Mozilla's recent involvement at Mobile World Congress](https://blog.webmaker.org/reflections-on-mobile-world-congress-the-power-of-an-open-mobile-web), we see a big opportunity to teach mobile web literacy while inviting creativitity connected to locally relevant content.


So it's a crowded space, and we know
We have to have a strong point of view about how we’re different in this landscape.
Teaching web literacy increases people’s understanding about the opportunity and potential of the web, that is anchored, supported and informed by Mozilla’s values.
Within this landscape, we know we have unique point-of-view, but may need to sharpen it more. 
Our model for leadership development empowers education leaders that can then take our tools, mission and practices into their work.

Slide 14 - User Sentiment [MICHELLE]
These next two slides represent what we’re hearing from our community regarding what’s working, or how they’re articulating their needs. 
These quotations have surfaced through high-touch, high-quality relationships with lead users. 

Background:
First quote is from a middle school student that participated in an afterschool program in NYC, developed in partnership with us. 
Next quote speaks to the point that many of our local leaders are volunteers, and they’re passionate and committed, but still need support - everything from teaching materials and techniques to secure resources.

Slide 15 - User Sentiment (cont.) [MICHELLE]
Here you’ll see a point from The CEO of a planetarium in Chicago about the impact Hive has brought to local organizations and the value of collaboration and innovation in our network.
Finally, another example of how we hope our new Clubs model fills the demand for deeper ways to engage with our work. We recognize that professional development is crucial and meet people’s existing practice with our mission. 
Slide 16 - Partnerships [MICHELLE]

We’ve been more intentional about how we work with partners. Developed thoughtful partnership criteria together with engagement. 
We’re actively seeking partners that can help us I) activate more mentors II) in more cities. It’s important that they share our values and commit to improving our offering.  
These are a few examples of partners that meet our criteria of depth, spread and participation.

Slide 17 - Funding Pipeline [CHRIS]
We’re actively bringing in revenue to support our work through institutional fundraising and grants. Here are some recent awards and some we’re going after.
All looking to forward our core vision and work, and bring new opportunities and challenges. 
Brief detail about recent awards

Slide 18 - Q2 Goals [CHRIS]

The process for honing our plans started in Oct at MozFest, leading to Portland and through Q1. 
We took time to be reflective, make sense of our work and progress in the last two years–when we came back Jan. 5 we were ready to hit the ground. 
Q1 was about general planning, setting up new systems after having merged several teams, testing, and developing a brand-new new initiative. In Q2 we’ll be focused on growth, building our volunteer pipeline, adding value to our offering.

Slide 19 - Q2 Key Initiatives (Hive/Clubs/Teach) [MICHELLE]

Clubs:
Onboard volunteer Regional Coordinators with training and new organizing protocols. 
Continue curriculum development – incl. Privacy, Mobile and “Teach like Mozilla”

Hive
Clubs as an on-ramp for emerging Hives. Also we’ll merge some of our emerging Hive leaders with our Clubs volunteer roles.
Existing Hive cities are developing more best practices
We’ll also finalize a fundraising toolkit–something we’ve heard a lot of demand for. 

Teach.mozilla.org
The site will launch, 
we’ll start to build a directory for volunteers to have horizontal visibility, to connect with each other and dynamically add new curriculum

Slide 20 - Key Initiatives (Maker Party/MozFest/Badges) [MICHELLE]

Badges
Enhance the current system
Build out new programmatic badges, while maintaining & issuing existing badges

Maker Party
Setup the campaign, develop messaging and marketing plan
Curate the party toolkit: activity, resources and assets

Finalize several critical logistical pieces
 

##  How You Can Help
Here are some of our key challenges. We'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback for how we might adress these as we head into Q2. 

****It's hard to track "sustained engagement."**** We often rely on contributors to self-report their activity. How can we incentivize updates and reflection from community members? How do other orgs tackle this? 

****Establishing new brand relationships.**** Our current community of educators grew in deep connection with Webmaker products, however in 2015 we made a decision to more closely align learning network efforts with the Mozilla brand. How can we best transition the community through this - understanding there will still be overlap and connectors?

****Quantifying impact.**** We’re getting better at demonstrating quantity, as in the numbers of events, or cities reached, but those measurements of growth are a surrogate for impact -- and it isn’t enough. How do we get better at measuring the relationships we’re building to support the open web for teaching and learning?
