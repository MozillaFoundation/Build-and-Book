## <a name="start"></a>Getting started with GitHub Issues

1. **[Create a free GitHub account](https://github.com/)** if you don't already have one. Pick a nickname that's obvious or close to your own name, to make it easier for colleagues to find you.
2. [Log in](https://github.com/login)
3. **Fill out your [profile](https://github.com/settings/profile)**
4. **Get added to Mozilla Foundation**. Ask one of the [owners group](https://github.com/orgs/MozillaFoundation/teams/owners) members to add you to the ["MozillaFoundation" organization](https://github.com/MozillaFoundation).


### Play around

Here's a [testing sandbox](https://github.com/k88hudson/githubtraining) you can play around in, to get your feet wet with filing, labeling and playing around with tickets.  

## <a name="im_stuck"></a>What should I do if I'm stuck or have a question?

* Ask in #webmaker IRC. 
* For Learning Networks: ask Lainie or Hannah. 
* For Learning Products: ask Wex, Cassie or Andrew. 
* For all else: ask OpenMatt. 
* If you don't know who any of these people are: ask a friend, colleague, anyone.

We're here to help -- no question is too big or small.
